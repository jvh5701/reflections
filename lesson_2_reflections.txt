1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?

When a repository is initialized, the .git directory is created.  You
need to do this so that the relevant data for git is created.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place to which items are added prior to making a
commit. A commit will add the files in the staging area to the
repository.  The working directory is simply the directory in which the
files exist.  The concept of a staging area allows users to fine tune
which changes are included in any given commit to the repository.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

You can add only the files that were edited in the logical change to the
staging area rather than every file that was changed since the last
commit.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful in working on an experimental change without
affecting the master branch.  Branches would help by isolating any
changes from the master branch.
