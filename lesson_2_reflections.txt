What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized, the .git directory is created.  You need to 
do this so that the relevant data for git is created. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place to which items are added prior to making a commit.
A commit will add the staging area to the repository.  The working directory is simply the directory in which the files exist.  The concept of a staging area
allows users to fine tune which changes are included in any given commit to the
repository.
