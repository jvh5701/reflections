1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

One might wish to use a remote repository when working on a project with
a team.  This allows team members to share their work using a common
source.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually triggering a pull allows users to choose specifically when they want
new code to apper on their local machines.  This could be because they 
are on a limited network connection or because they don't want other changes 
interfering with their local environment.
