1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

One might wish to use a remote repository when working on a project with
a team.  This allows team members to share their work using a common
source.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually triggering a pull allows users to choose specifically when they want
new code to apper on their local machines.  This could be because they 
are on a limited network connection or because they don't want other changes 
interfering with their local environment.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

Forks and clones are closely related.  A fork is merely a type of clone that
exists on GitHub.  A branch is another string of commits within a repository.
One might use a branch when testing an experimental feature within a project.
One might use a fork when attempting to make another project based off of an
existing GitHub project.  Forking allows a user to maintain their own 
independent path while referencing the original project.
